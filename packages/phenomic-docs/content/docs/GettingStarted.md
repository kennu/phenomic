## Installation

```console
$ npm install -g create-phenomic-app
```

## Usage

```console
$ create-phenomic-app path/to/where/to/install
```

This command line will bootstrap a new Phenomic project with a basic layout and a `helloworld` post.

This can take a little while since it installs the actual dependencies at this point.

```console
$ cd path/to/where/to/install
$ npm start
```

And you're ready to write some posts and customize the look of the website.

You're ready?

```
$ npm run build
```

And your pre-rendered website is waiting to be deployed in `dist`
